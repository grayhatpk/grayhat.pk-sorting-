This algorithm is sorting whole numbers with O(n) time complexity. 

------Working of Algorithm

for example take an array of length 5 {7,1,9,4,10}. Create an another array of length of greatest element in the array and store 1 at corresponding location like 
Before 
{0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0}
After 
{0,1,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,1,1}
Now iterate the array and print the index where the 1 is stored.
